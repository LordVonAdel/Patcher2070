# Unofficial Anno 2070 Mod SDK

The idea is to have an api that modifies existing game files without completely replacing them. All modifications possible should be done via the api to ensure compatibility to other mods. 
Another positive point is that it is not needed to distribute original game files.

## Features
What the API can do at the moment:
- Extract game files from .rda archives
- Replace/Add any game file inside an .rda archive
- Add player colors
- Add/Change strings supporting multiple languages
- Change assets (Buildings, Vehicles, etc.)
- Replace the news server for main menu news
- Extract icons as single files
- Add/Change style classes for tooltips
- Change values in Engine.ini

What it can't do at the moment:
- Add products (wares)
- Add items
- Add/remove assets (buildings, vehicles, etc.)
- Add/Change/Remove islands
- Add/Change/Remove missions
- Add 3d Models
